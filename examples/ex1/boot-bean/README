Examples for bootable service components (beans) 
and corresponding requestors with an internal code servers (websters).

For prerequisites and how to run Ant scripts see the README file in the ex1 directory.

Two versions of examples that illustrate a behavioral transfer between the requestor 
and provider and the need for a code server (webster):
	1. The requestor in the first case,  whoIsItBean1, needs a webster to export its signature interface 
	   to lookup services and it does not use any classes unknown to its provider
	2. The requestor in the second case, whoIsItBean2, needs additionally to exchange messages with the provider. 
	   Both requestor and provider implement differently their messages of the sorcer.ex1.Message type,
	   so both need to exchange their message implementations using their websters on both ends. 
	   The case two illustrates also how to access the bean enclosing provider by its name
	   and shows how exceptions and traces are transfered to the requestor from the provider.
