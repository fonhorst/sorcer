This example illustrates three different types of requestors 
that use the Worker services defined in the example ex2. 

	1. FlowWorkerRunner
		- allows via its properties (configs/worker-run.properties) to control the behavior component exertions: 
			a) flow (sequential or parallel) within the enclosing exertion
			b) network access of components to providers. Components can be pushed to providers (Acess.PUSH) 
			   or pulled (Acess.PULL) from the network by providers matching their signatures.
	2. PipingWorkerRunner
		- creates a pipe of three Worker services via data context pipes
	3. SharedContextWorkerRunner
		- uses a collaboration of three Worker services that share a distributed data context in the network
		
For prerequisites and how to run Ant scripts see the README file in the ex1 directory.
		
First, start in ex2/bin all workers:
	worker1-prv-run.xml
	worker2-prv-run.xml
	worker3-prv-run.xml
	
then run worker requestors in ex3/bin
